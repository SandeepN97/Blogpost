## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- Maven or Gradle
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/username/blog-application.git
   cd blog-application
   ```

2. Set the `JWT_SECRET` environment variable for token generation (optional):
   ```sh
   export JWT_SECRET=yourStrongSecret
   ```

3. Start the React frontend (optional):
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   python -m http.server 3000
   ```
   Then open [http://localhost:3000/index.html](http://localhost:3000/index.html) in your browser.

4. Ensure a MySQL server is running on `localhost:3306` with a database named
   `blogpostapplication` and credentials `root`/`root`. If your database
   configuration differs, update the values in
   `src/main/resources/application.properties` accordingly.


### API Documentation

After starting the Spring Boot application, you can explore all REST endpoints interactively using Swagger UI. Visit:

```

http://localhost:8084/blogpostapplication/swagger-ui.html
```

Swagger resources are publicly accessible, so no authentication is required to browse the docs. The generated OpenAPI specification is also available at `/blogpostapplication/v3/api-docs` and can be used to generate client libraries.
